# input_rollup javascript jquery
Function to concatenate form input elements into composite one liner (e.g. address)

 Collapses/hides a group of form fields concactenating the values into one line
 and adds a button to unhide it for editing. This is handy for things like addresses and
 phone fields to put more information into horizontal view vs long list of small pieces
 of info.

 Depends on jquery.

 Assumes you are using html table, but easy to adapt to other layouts.
